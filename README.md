# Information Repository for the TBDT Minecraft Worlds

## Contributing

- fork this repo if you want to add to initial `atlas` database. I'll gladly take PRs but as `atlas` gets more advanced it'l be harder to manually add and easier to just use the command. But for a little bit, `atlas` won't be saving any new coords permanently unless they're in the file so put your house in there!
